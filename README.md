The purpose of this program is to create a bullet-hell styled game.

The main objective was to create a challenging 2d game that synced to the beat 
of my composed song to flow with the song using colour pulsating to change in-game background effects. 

I added KeyboardInputs using WASD to control a cube with the main objective 
to survive through dodging randomized on-screen projectiles moving towards the player.
